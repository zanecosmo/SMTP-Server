# SMTP-Server
A basic email-forwarding server for use in website contact forms.

Purpose:
* create a utility that can route emails from contact forms to email inboxes.
* learn more about HTTP requests, CORS, Fetch API, and error handling
* implement a Google API, and learn the basics of OAuth2

#### Possible Features
* reorganize the code into a flexible library so that I can more easily implement the functionality into different front-end projects.

As of yet, the server only responds to requests from specific private origins, so it is not an exposed API.

## About
The server is hosted on Heroku, uses an Express/Node.js backend, and employs several common libraries, including Nodemailer, Dotenv, CORS Middleware, and Google's Gmail API.
